# Create Your First Agent — Local Developer Onboarding

Build a small, safe AI agent on your machine, send its activity to
ObserveAgents, and watch it appear in the product. Beginner-friendly and
copy/paste oriented — everything runs locally with fake data.

## 1. What you will build

A tiny Python "agent" that performs a harmless fake task (an invoice status
lookup), reports what it did to ObserveAgents, and then shows up in:

- **Agent Inventory** — your agent is auto-discovered with its owner/team/environment
- **Runtime** — the activity itself (two views: **Traces** and **Agent events**)
- **Rules & Alerts** — if the activity trips a detection rule, a finding appears
- **Metrics** — daily per-agent rollups update after the worker processes events

There are two connection methods:

| | Option A — OTLP / OpenTelemetry | Option B — Gateway key / Runtime events |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | Agents already instrumented with OpenTelemetry-style traces/spans | Agents that report activity directly using an ObserveAgents `gk-` key |
| Endpoint | `POST /otel/v1/traces` | `POST /api/v1/telemetry/batch` (also: `POST /runtime-events`) |
| Shows up in | Agent Inventory + Runtime → **Traces** | Agent Inventory + Runtime → **Agent events** + Rules & Alerts + metrics |

Both use the same `gk-` API key for authentication. **Note the key format is
`gk-` with a dash** (e.g. `gk-a1b2c3...`), not `gk_`.

## 2. Prerequisites

- ObserveAgents backend running locally (default `http://localhost:8000`)
- Dashboard running (or the combined server serving the built dashboard)
- Python 3.10+ installed
- Visual Studio Code installed (optional: GitHub Copilot enabled)
- A valid `gk-` API key — create one in the dashboard under
  **Administration → API Keys** (copy it once; it is never shown again)
- A `.env` file for secrets (created below)

> ⚠️ **Never hardcode API keys, routing keys, tokens, passwords, or customer
> data in code.** Keep secrets in `.env` (and keep `.env` out of git).

## 3. Project setup in VS Code

```bash
mkdir observeagents-first-agent
cd observeagents-first-agent
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

Create these files (VS Code: File → New File):

```text
.env
agent_otlp.py
agent_gateway.py
README.md
```

## 4. Option A — OTLP / OpenTelemetry path

This option sends telemetry as an OpenTelemetry trace to the real OTLP
endpoint: **`POST /otel/v1/traces`**. ObserveAgents parses the span, discovers
the agent from `service.name` / resource attributes, and stores
privacy-scrubbed runtime evidence (prompts/responses are never stored on this
path — only structure and metadata).

### `.env` for OTLP

```env
OBSERVEAGENTS_OTLP_URL=http://localhost:8000/otel/v1/traces
OBSERVEAGENTS_API_KEY=gk-REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY
AGENT_ID=billing-agent-otlp-local
AGENT_NAME=Billing Agent OTLP Local
AGENT_TEAM=Finance
AGENT_ENVIRONMENT=development
AGENT_OWNER=ron@example.com
```

- `OBSERVEAGENTS_OTLP_URL` — the OTLP traces endpoint on your backend
- `OBSERVEAGENTS_API_KEY` — your `gk-` key (sent as a Bearer token)
- `AGENT_ID` — the stable identity; becomes the discovered agent
- `AGENT_TEAM` / `AGENT_ENVIRONMENT` / `AGENT_OWNER` — governance metadata shown in Agent Inventory

### `agent_otlp.py`

            }]
        }]
    }]
}

resp = requests.post(
    URL,
    json=payload,
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
    timeout=15,

print("HTTP", resp.status_code)
print(resp.text)
if resp.status_code == 202:
    print("✓ Trace accepted — check Runtime → Traces and Agent Inventory.")
elif resp.status_code == 401:
    print("✗ Auth failed — check OBSERVEAGENTS_API_KEY in .env (gk- prefix).")
else:
    print("✗ Unexpected response — check the endpoint URL and payload.")
```

Run it:

```bash
python agent_otlp.py
```

### Verify OTLP in the dashboard

1. Open the ObserveAgents dashboard and log in.
2. Go to **Agents** (Agent Inventory) — find *billing-agent-otlp-local* with
   its team/owner/environment.
3. Open **Runtime** — the **Traces** view shows your agent's execution trace
   (grouped by agent; click it to see the span waterfall with provider,
   model, and token metadata).
4. OTLP spans appear as **traces/runtime activity** — the **Agent events**
   view is fed by Option B's batch API, so an OTLP-only agent shows its
   evidence in the Traces view.

## 5. Option B — Gateway key / Runtime events path

This option uses your ObserveAgents **gateway API key (`gk-`)** to report
agent activity directly. The primary endpoint is the batch telemetry API —
**`POST /api/v1/telemetry/batch`** — which feeds the richest product surface:
Runtime → **Agent events**, Rules & Alerts findings, and daily metrics.

> Naming note: in this repo, `gk-` keys are the gateway/ingestion credential
> (created under **API Keys**). The same key authenticates
> `/api/v1/telemetry/batch`, `/runtime-events`, and `/otel/v1/traces`.
> If you route live LLM traffic through the ObserveAgents Gateway proxy
> (`/v1/chat/completions` with an `X-Guard-Agent` header), that traffic is
> captured automatically — this guide simulates activity without a real
> provider call.

### `.env` for the Gateway key path

```env
OBSERVEAGENTS_TELEMETRY_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/telemetry/batch
OBSERVEAGENTS_RUNTIME_EVENTS_URL=http://localhost:8000/runtime-events
OBSERVEAGENTS_API_KEY=gk-REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_KEY
AGENT_ID=billing-agent-gateway-local
AGENT_NAME=Billing Agent Gateway Local
AGENT_TEAM=Finance
AGENT_ENVIRONMENT=development
AGENT_OWNER=ron@example.com
```

### `agent_gateway.py`

load_dotenv()

def base_event(**overrides):
    event = {

    base_event(
        event_type="llm_call",

        model="gpt-4o-mini",

    ),

    base_event(

        tool_name="crm_contact_search",
        action_name="support_ticket_summary",
        latency_ms=310,
    ),
]

resp = requests.post(
    URL,
    json={"events": events},
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
    timeout=15,
)
print("HTTP", resp.status_code)
print(resp.text)
if resp.status_code == 202:
    body = resp.json()
    print(f"✓ accepted={body['accepted']} duplicated={body['duplicated']} failed={body['failed']}")
    print("The background worker normalizes each event, scores it against the")
    print("detection rules, updates daily metrics, and registers the agent in")
    print("Agent Inventory — usually within a couple of seconds.")
elif resp.status_code == 401:
    print("✗ Auth failed — check OBSERVEAGENTS_API_KEY in .env (gk- prefix).")
else:
    print("✗ Rejected — check endpoint URL and event fields.")
```

Run it:

```bash
python agent_gateway.py
```

**How the data reaches the dashboard:** the API stores your exact payload and
returns immediately; an in-process worker then normalizes each event, runs the
real-time risk rules (producing `risk_score`, `risk_reasons`, `policy_action`),
updates the `agent_metrics_daily` rollups, and upserts the agent into the
Asset Registry — so Inventory, Agent events, findings, and metrics all light
up from one call.

### The `/runtime-events` alternative

The same `gk-` key also works with `POST /runtime-events`, the SDK-style
endpoint for normalized GenAI runtime events. Its schema is strict
(`extra="forbid"`); required fields are `source`, `agent_name`, `trace_id`,
`span_id`, `event_type`. Events sent here become spans and appear in
Runtime → **Traces** (like OTLP), not in Agent events. Use it when you want
the trace-shaped view without full OTel instrumentation.

### Verify in the dashboard

1. Open the dashboard and log in.
2. **Agents** (Agent Inventory) — find *billing-agent-gateway-local* with
   team `Finance`, your owner email, and environment `development`.
3. Open **Runtime** and switch the toggle to **Agent events**.
4. Pick your agent in the selector — both events appear with model/tool,
   latency, cost (marked `est` when computed from the pricing registry),
   status, and risk badges when rules fired.
5. Open **Rules & Alerts** — if any event tripped a rule, it's in
   **Recent findings** with the reason and a click-through back to the agent.
6. Metrics (summary cards and `GET /telemetry/metrics/daily`) update once the
   worker finishes — normally seconds.

## 6. Trigger a safe warning

Add one intentionally "noisy" event to see risk scoring work. Safe triggers:
high latency, unknown model, missing owner, error status, high token count.

Append this to the `events` list in `agent_gateway.py`:

```python
    # 3. a safe warning example: an error with very high latency
    base_event(
        event_type="tool_call",
        tool_name="invoice_lookup",
        status="error",
        error_message="Tool returned timeout (demo)",
        latency_ms=45000,
    ),
```

For OTLP, the equivalent is setting the span's
`"status": {"code": 2, "message": "timeout (demo)"}` and a long duration.

The error (+25) and high latency (+15) rules fire, so the event scores 40 —
a **medium risk** badge in Runtime → Agent events and a row in Rules &
Alerts → Recent findings (exact scores depend on which rules your admins
have enabled and their thresholds). To push it over the `policy: warn`
threshold (50), also omit the `owner` field (+10 for missing owner). Never
use shell execution, file deletion, credential access, or real PII to
trigger warnings.

## 7. Build the same agent with GitHub Copilot

Open Copilot Chat in VS Code and use these prompts.

**Copilot prompt — OTLP:**

```text
Create a Python script called agent_otlp.py that loads configuration from a .env file and sends a safe OpenTelemetry-style agent event to ObserveAgents using the OTLP endpoint. Include agent identity fields, provider/model, latency, token usage, and status. Do not hardcode secrets. Use requests and python-dotenv.
```

**Copilot prompt — Gateway key:**

```text
Create a Python script called agent_gateway.py that loads a Gateway routing key from a .env file and sends a safe simulated AI-agent runtime event to ObserveAgents through the Gateway / Runtime Events path. Include agent id, agent name, team, environment, owner, provider, model, latency, tokens, status, tool_name, and action_name. Do not hardcode secrets.
```

**Copilot prompt — error handling:**

```text
Add error handling to the script. Print the HTTP status code, response body, and a clear message explaining whether the event was accepted, duplicated, or failed.
```

**Copilot prompt — dashboard verification README:**

```text
Create a README section explaining how to run this local agent and verify the result in ObserveAgents Agent Inventory, Runtime Agent events, and Rules & Alerts.
```

Review what Copilot generates against the endpoint names and field lists in
this guide before running it — especially the `gk-` Bearer auth header and
the exact endpoint paths.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing/invalid key — must be `Authorization: Bearer gk-...`; check the key is active in API Keys |
| `404 Not Found` | Wrong endpoint path — use `/otel/v1/traces`, `/api/v1/telemetry/batch`, or `/runtime-events` exactly |
| `413 Payload Too Large` | Too many events in one request (batch max 1,000; runtime-events max 500) |
| `accepted: 0, duplicated: 1` | Same `event_id` already sent — dedup is per `(org, event_id)`; generate a new UUID per event |
| `422` on `/runtime-events` | Strict schema — unknown fields are rejected; check required `source`/`agent_name`/`trace_id`/`span_id`/`event_type` |
| Agent not visible | Wait a few seconds for worker processing, then refresh Agent Inventory |
| Agent events empty | Check you're on the **Agent events** view (not Traces), the right agent is selected, and the time range covers your event's timestamp |
| Rules & Alerts empty | The event may not trigger any enabled rule — try the warning example in §6 |
| Metrics not updated | Rollups update after worker processing — wait and refresh |
| Connection refused | Backend port differs — match `.env` URLs to where the backend actually runs |
| CORS errors | You're calling from a browser page — call the API from Python/curl instead, or go through the dashboard's dev proxy |

## 9. Data safety

- Use **fake test data** only.
- Never send secrets: no passwords, tokens, API keys, or credentials as
  telemetry field values.
- Never send private customer data or PII.
- The batch API **preserves your raw payload byte-for-byte** for
  investigation — whatever you send is stored. Send metadata about activity,
  not content. (The OTLP path stores content hashes only.)
- Use `environment=development` for local testing so test agents are clearly
  separated from production.

## 10. Optional curl examples

OTLP:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/otel/v1/traces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gk-YOUR_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resourceSpans":[{"resource":{"attributes":[{"key":"service.name","value":{"stringValue":"curl-demo-agent"}}]},"scopeSpans":[{"spans":[{"traceId":"5b8efff798038103d269b633813fc60c","spanId":"eee19b7ec3c1b174","name":"chat gpt-4o-mini","kind":3,"startTimeUnixNano":"1752570000000000000","endTimeUnixNano":"1752570001000000000","attributes":[{"key":"gen_ai.operation.name","value":{"stringValue":"chat"}},{"key":"gen_ai.system","value":{"stringValue":"openai"}},{"key":"gen_ai.request.model","value":{"stringValue":"gpt-4o-mini"}}],"status":{}}]}]}]}'
```

Batch telemetry (Gateway key path):

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/telemetry/batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gk-YOUR_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"events":[{"event_id":"demo-1","agent_id":"curl-demo-agent","agent_name":"Curl Demo Agent","team":"Finance","owner":"ron@example.com","environment":"development","event_type":"llm_call","provider":"openai","model":"gpt-4o-mini","input_tokens":100,"output_tokens":20,"latency_ms":800,"status":"ok"}]}'
```
